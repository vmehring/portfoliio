        <h2 role="presentation">Licton Springs Park</h2>
        <p> This was a capstone project for completing the UW Certificate
          in restoration ecology. It was a design-build project that involved
          consultation with Friends of Licton Springs Park, a local advocacy
          group, as well as assistance from the Seattle Department of Parks
          and Recreation.</p>
        <p>Our design team researched the history, current usage, and ecology
          of Licton Springs Park. We selected an area around the creek and up to
          the west edge of the park for treatment. The first step was removal
          of invasive plants. Holly and blackberry were pulled, and reed canary
          grass along the stream was mowed by SDPR. A double layer of cardboard
          was laid down to act as a weed barrier, and topped with four to six inches
          of mulch. More large woody debris - logs and branches - were added to
          the site. After the cardboard had softened, native trees and shrubs
          were planted, and willow stakes were planted along the stream.</p>
